# FAQ

## **What is** AlphaPo**?**

AlphaPo is a business service and software product created to solve topical problems connected with payments, cryptocurrency exchange and storage for businesses.

## **How can I test your service?**

We can provide you with a trial account at AlphaPo, where you can familiarise yourself with the merchant dashboard and test all the tools, but some pre-test steps are required from you:

1\) Download a testnet Bitcoin wallet.

3\) Wait for 1 confirmation to be able to spend test coins.

\*Please note that Testnet Bitcoins are never supposed to have any value. More information about Bitcoin testnet is available[ here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Testnet).

## **How much does AlphaPo charge for its processing service?**

Integration is free. We only charge transaction fees. Transaction types are: deposit, withdrawal and exchange, we also have transaction combinations, such as deposits with instant exchange.The fees depend on the required options and the merchant’s business model. Please apply at [sales@alphapo.net](mailto:sales@alphapo.net) for an individual commercial offer.

## **What alternative payments do you support?**

At the moment we accept several altcoins \(BTC, BCH, LTC, ETH, USDC, DOGE, DASH\) and ERC20 tokens. 

We are working on adding more currencies.

## **How can I convert all these different coins to BTC?**

AlphaPo provides the opportunity for merchants to send and receive cryptocurrencies inside their account in AlphaPo, crediting the counter-party’s balance in the required coin. This option is available with the help of API for business.

## **Can I convert coins to EUR?**

Yes. AlphaPo has a built-in instant exchange function. It allows AlphaPo merchants to exchange the cryptocurrency paid by the customer into the fiat currency chosen by the seller immediately.

## **How often can I expect settlements?**

We make settlements by your request, we don't use rolling reserves so 100% of the funds are available for withdrawal anytime. We have an auto withdrawal option for cryptocurrency, the system makes settlements automatically when the account balance reaches a certain threshold.

## **Is it safe to keep our money in your wallet?**

Absolutely. Customer funds are stored in an offline cold wallet, which is protected from cyber attacks.

Operational, or “hot” wallet, holds funds required for automated operations, such as multiple payments to your clients. This wallet holds the AlphaPo operational funds. So we have you covered.

Prior to integration, the operator decides how much money he wants to keep in our system, thereby setting storage limits. All funds exceeding these limits \(bankroll\) will be automatically transferred to the operator's external address.
